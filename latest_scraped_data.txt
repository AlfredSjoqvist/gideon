The goal is to provide a proof of concept for model A. Full scale training is very costly, so you think of overfitting these models first to see whether they can solve the problem or not. You then see that both models do, indeed, overfit, but in different timings. Can you draw conclusions about models A and B? Does training full scale is the ultimate answer for your comparison?
